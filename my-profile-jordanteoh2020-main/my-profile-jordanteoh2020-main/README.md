# :wave: My Profile

## ü§ì Objective
The goal of "My Profile" assignment is to give every student an opportunity build a beautiful, interactive, and responsive website on a weekly basis. This is a term-long assignment (Week 1 through Week 16), and it will count towards your **Class Participation**.

This **README** will be updated by the teaching team on a weekly basis on Wednesday evenings. Please ensure to check this **README** on Wednesdays and check what is due weekly.

## (Week 5) üëπ: Addition of Javascript
Biggest nightmare since i have no idea what to add as of now. But managed to add some colours to the fonts and the background just to make the page seem colourful but will probably change to an image background with coloured words.

## (Week 4) üç∂: Adding even more Bootstrap
I added more bootstrap which is mainly just a carousel function to include more images of some manhwa i read to tell you more about myself. Some of it are snippets of some animes that i have watched as well.

## (Week 3) ü•¶: Adding Bootstrap
Added a card function to enclose my own description of myself while including the picture as a card image. Resized it to a smaller picture so that it does not look too stretched though the outline of the card can be seen with blank spaces at the side. Added a nav bar while trying to figure out how it works although it is not complete and does not lead to anywhere.

## (Week 2) üèØ: Using CSS to style
I added my own biography, where i changed the fonts while bolding it and adding a border to it. As i did not have a favourite destination to go, i added a youtube video of a country that i would like to visit but never had the chance to, while giving a header for it, which is coloured.
I added a picture of a manhwa that I liked instead of my own picture

## (Week 1) :octocat: Git/GitHub & Your First Code Commit/Push
The goal this week is for you to understand what **Git** is and how **GitHub** works.
* Please check out this ["Git and GitHub Starter Course"](https://github.com/is216-supreme/github-starter-course).

Next, you're invited to "My Profile" classroom assignment
* If you don't have a GitHub account, **please sign up and ensure to add your SMU email address as either primary or secondary**.
* You will get a **verification email** in your SMU Inbox. Click and **verify**. Now, your GitHub account is ready!
* Click on the invite URL that your prof (or TA) provided to you. This is an invite to **My Profile** assignment.
* In your web browser, you will see this. Click **Authorize GitHub Classrom**. <img src="images/GitHub_01.jpg" width="400px">
* Click **Skip to the next step **. <img src="images/GitHub_02.jpg" width="400px">
* Click **Accept this assignment**. <img src="images/GitHub_03.jpg" width="400px">
* You will see this. Wait for 10 seconds and Refresh browser. <img src="images/GitHub_04.jpg" width="400px">
* Click **Open in Visual Studio Code**. <img src="images/GitHub_05.jpg" width="400px">
* In **Visual Studio Code**, you'll see this. Click **Install**. <img src="images/GitHub_06.jpg" width="400px">
* In **web browser**, you'll see this. Click **Authorize github**. <img src="images/GitHub_07.jpg" width="400px">
* In **Visual Studio Code**, you'll see this. Click **Open**. <img src="images/GitHub_08.jpg" width="400px">
* Click **Allow**. <img src="images/GitHub_09.jpg" width="400px">
* Check **File Explorer** panel on the left. You will see these files. <img src="images/GitHub_10.jpg" width="200px">

Next, let's go update your **index.html**.
* The skeleton **index.html** is just a template.
* Update **index.html** with **your information**.
* Your Github repo is **private** and is only visible to your prof and TAs.

So far, the changes you've made reside locally on your computer. Your prof and TAs cannot see them.
* Let's push your **changes** (from local computer) to your (remote) GitHub repo.
* In **GitHub**, this takes 2 steps: **1) Commit** and **2) Push**.
* ---
* First, in your web browser, go to your own **My Profile** GitHub repo. <img src="images/GitHub_11.jpg" width="100px">
* In my case, my remote repo address is https://github.com/is216-supreme/my-profile-connectappsmu. Yours will be having a different suffix.
* ---
* In **Visual Studio Code**, look for this button on the left side. Click on it. 
* You will see this. It shows the previous file content on left (red) and new content on right (green). <img src="images/GitHub_12.jpg" width="800px">
* In the top left corner, you will see. <img src="images/GitHub_13.jpg" width="200px">
* Under **Changes**, you will see one or more files with changes made locally. In our case, we made changes to only 1 file. Click **Changes** (or index.html) and above it, in the text field, write briefly what this **commit** is for.
* When done, click the **tick** sign.
* You'll see this. Click **Yes**. <img src="images/GitHub_14.jpg" width="500px">
* Click on 3-dot sign. Click **Push**. <img src="images/GitHub_15.jpg" width="400px">
* ---- By now, your changes should've been pushed to your My Profile **remote** GitHub repo ---
* In **web browser**, go to your My Profile GitHub repo.
* Go there and click on **index.html**. Do you see the latest changes you just pushed from your local computer?
* Here's mine. Looks like it's updated! <img src="images/GitHub_16.jpg" width="500px">

If you're stuck, please don't forget to visit **Slack** and post questions in **#troubleshoot**.
