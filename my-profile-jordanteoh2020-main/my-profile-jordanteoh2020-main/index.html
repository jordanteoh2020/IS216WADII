                    One of the many things about me that isn't important

                    <p>
                        I have been playing Ultimate Frisbee since I was in JC, stopped during army and started again
                        with SMU Ultimate
                        Frisbee. A funny thing is that I absolutely hate long distance running but somehow managed to
                        stick in this
                        sport for so long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An interesting fact about me is that I was supposedly going overseas to study but because of
                        Covid, I had to
                        stay in Singapore, and was not able to change my university course without taking a gap year. I
                        also did not
                        know that what I applied for in 2018 in SMU IS changed in 2019.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, I need to make more friends especially in IS since semester 1 was online.
